# Procyberian Systems Distribution Hello World 

Procyberian Systems Distribution(PSD) is a Free Software GNU/Linux distribution based on Debian GNU/Linux Operating System.

* **Our roadmap is**:

* To test GTK and Qt frameworks
* To write or edit adaptive applications
* To create our own Debian package server service
* To build a Debian based ISO for virtual machines for both servers and clients as a development and test image which will be updated once a year
* Every year a beta ISO
* Every five year a stable ISO which follows the support lifecycle like Debian
